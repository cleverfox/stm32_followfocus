# Electronic follow focus

Goal of this project is developing of mechanical zoom / follow focus controller
which can be controlled over PWM and/or S.BUS interfaces. As hardware I use
CMF-01 motor from ZHIYUN Crane 2 steadycam. As for writing time CMF-01
can be bought for about 30-40 USD. Other drives significantly more expesive.

As for now I develop firmware on external stm32 mcu, but lately I going to port
it to stm32f411ccu6, but I have no idea how to program it yet, due to 
SWD disabled.
