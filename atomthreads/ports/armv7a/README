Following are the steps to add new board <abc> under armv7a port:
1. Create a directory under ports/armv7a with name <abc>
2. Add linker.ld in ports/armv7a/<abc> (similar to the one in ports/armv7a/pb-a8)
3. Add arm_pic.h, arm_timer.h, and arm_uart.h in ports/armv7a/<abc> (similar to the one in ports/armv7a/pb-a8)
4. Add .c files in ports/armv7a/<abc> to implement the board specific functions expected in arm_pic.h, arm_timer.h, and arm_uart.h
5. Add Makefile in ports/armv7a/<abc> (similar to the one in ports/armv7a/pb-a8) to build board specific objects corresponding to the .c files added in step 4.
5. To build atomthreads for <abc> board use following command "make BOARD=<abc>" with ports/armv7a as current directory.
