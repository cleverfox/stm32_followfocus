 * Main thread stack size
 *
 * Note that this is not a required OS kernel thread - you will replace
 * this with your own application thread.
 *
 * In this case the Main thread is responsible for calling out to the
 * test routines. Once a test routine has finished, the test status is
 * printed out on the UART and the thread remains running in a loop.
 *
 * The Main thread stack generally needs to be larger than the idle
 * thread stack, as not only does it need to store interrupt handler
 * stack saves and context switch saves, but the application main thread
 * will generally be carrying out more nested function calls and require
 * stack for application code local variables etc.
 *
 * 1KB might be adequate but if using printf() then at least 2KB would be
 * prudent otherwise the stdio functions otherwise stack overruns are
 * likely. Nearly 2KB was seen to be used on the toolchain used for
 * development.
